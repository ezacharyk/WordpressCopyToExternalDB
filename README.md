# WordpressCopyToExternalDB

This is a simple Wordpress Plugin that simply creates a copy of a blog post on Wordpress to an external database when the blog is published. It does this by connecting to the provided database using Wordpress' built in database interface and then inserting the blog data to the provided table in that database.

The purpose of this plugin was so that blog posts on the client's Wordpress site could be displayed without the need for RSS Feeds on a secondary platform.
